- DHCP: A mechanism that automates IP configuration, including IP address, subnet mask, default gateway and DNS information.
- Class C: the default IP address class available
- Which IP address class has more host addresses available by default? FIRST
- What type of address is supported by DHCP: IPV4 and IPV6
- Domain name system: translates Internet domain names and host names into IP addresses
- the size of an IPV4 address: 32 bits
- the size of an IPV6 address? 128 bits

TCP

- connection-oriented protocol
- not support broadcasting
- extended error checking mechanisms(it provides flow control and data acknowledgement)
- reliable(it guarantees the delivery of data to the router of the destination)
- Data sequencing(packets arrive in order in the recipient)

UDP

- datagram oriented protocol
- supports broadcasting
- the basic error control mechanism only
- The delivery of data to the destination cannot be guaranteed
- faster, simpler and more efficient than TCP

ip address

- IP 클래스의 종류는 A~E
- IP주소 계산기 활용법

private IP address
- 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255
- 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
- 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255

To test the IP stack on your local host, which IP address would you ping?
- 127.0.0.1
